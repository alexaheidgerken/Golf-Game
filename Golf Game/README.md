# GolfGame

- Used TypeScript and GopherGfx to build a 3D graphics program
- Drew simple 3D geometric objects
- Worked effectively with 3D points, vectors, and geometric transformations
- Balance the tradeoffs between realism and effective gameplay by simulating physics in a plausible but not necessarily realistic way
